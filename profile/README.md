# Digital Service at CMS (DSACMS)
We're a group of civic-minded technologists transforming how the federal government delivers healthcare to the American people. The Digital Service at CMS (DSAC) consists of engineers, designers, and product managers—serving our country by building and maintaining the technology underpinning our national health care programs. 

# Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
Every day, millions of people in this country interact with the healthcare system. We believe these interactions should be straightforward, transparent and seamless. Whether it's looking for health insurance, making sense of medical bills, or researching nursing homes, we are working to unlock medical information and empower people with health data.

- 76M people on Medicaid & CHIP (2024)
- 67M people on Medicare (2024)
- 21M found insurance in ACA marketplace (2024)

# What does the Digital Service at CMS do?
